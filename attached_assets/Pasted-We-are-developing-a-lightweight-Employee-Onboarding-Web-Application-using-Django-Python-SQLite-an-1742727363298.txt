We are developing a lightweight Employee Onboarding Web Application using Django, Python, SQLite, and Bootstrap. The application will streamline the onboarding process for new hires by providing a centralized portal where employees can view and complete their onboarding tasks. The system will use a simple, database-driven authentication mechanism where employees log in using their Employee ID and password. Initially, the password will be set to the same value as the Employee ID, which can be changed later.

Upon login, employees will be directed to a dashboard that displays task cards. Each card represents an onboarding task with relevant instructions, external links, or a pre-filled email action (e.g., to contact specific teams). The task cards will have visual status indicators, where employees can mark them as Not Started (Red), In Progress (Yellow), or Completed (Green). This progress will be tracked in the database for reporting and follow-up.

The application will feature an Admin Tab, visible only to users with admin privileges. In this section, admins can create, update, or delete onboarding tasks (cards). Each card can be categorized by type (email, link, or instructions) and can be assigned to specific job profiles such as Developer, Analyst, or other roles. This allows the onboarding experience to be tailored based on an employeeâ€™s specific role.

Additionally, there will be an Enroll Tab, also restricted to users with specific permissions (e.g., Admin or Enroller role). This tab will enable admins to register new employees by filling out key details such as Employee ID, Name, Manager Name, and Job Type. Based on the job type selected, onboarding tasks will be automatically assigned to the employee. The newly enrolled employee will then be able to log in using their Employee ID as both their username and initial password.

The app will use Bootstrap to create a clean and responsive user interface, ensuring the application looks professional while remaining easy to use. This solution will improve the onboarding workflow by giving employees a clear view of their tasks and allowing the admin team to easily track, manage, and assign tasks across different departments or job roles.
